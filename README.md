# Adopt-a-Friend

Tyler Hodge, Deanna Madon and Jaime Padilla have worked together to create Adopt-a-Friend, a website that matches humans with pets. We seek to also educate users about animal breeds so they can make informed decisions about a pet that will be a good fit for their lifestyle.

## Description

This project provides the functionality for pet-seekers to search for pets in their area based on their criteria. 

* When the user searches for pets, they are presented with individual pet cards with summarized information about each pet that matches their search.
* When the user clicks on a pet photo, they are taken to a page with more information about that individual pet as well as an embeded google map of their location.
* When the user clicks on a pet's "favorite" button, that pet is saved to local storage.
* When the user clicks on "My Favorites" from the page header, they are presented with a page of animal cards for all of the animals they have saved as favorites.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* JavaScript
* Materialize CSS Framework
* Custom CSS
* Petfinder API
* Animals Api
* Google map embed API

## Breakdown of Tasks and Roles

* Tyler: integration of Animals API for breed information
* Deanna: Petfinder API integration, page design and setup, localStorage functionality for favorite pets, Google embed maps API
* Jaime: user input form for pet search criteria

## Directions for Future Development

* Improve application's mobile responsiveness
* Get full pet biographies from the Petfinder API and integrate them into the pet details page
* Add user's search criteria to session storage so that when a user comes back to search page after visiting the favorites page or the pet detail page, thier search criteria remains in the form where they left it
* Add pagination for home page
